# bikeshare

BikeSharefacilitates the process of renting bicycles for short periods. It allows users to locate and rent bikes through a mobile application. Users can search for nearby bike stations, view bike availability, and select a bike to rent. The app typically provides details about each bike, such as its location, type, and availability status. Users can make a reservation or directly unlock the bike using the app, and they are usually charged based on the rental duration.
